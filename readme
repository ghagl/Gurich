Gurich is a free software printer driver for Ricoh SP112.

In order to install this driver, please see the INSTALL file.
Contributions to this project is welcome, but please follow the code style used in this driver.

If you want a driver with warranty, then use Ricoh's driver for Microsoft(R) Windows.

I am not affilated with nor employed by Ricoh, this project is done in my spare time.
All trademarks mentioned in this project are owned by their respective owner.

== Features ==
* Printing (A4 with 600 and 1200 DPI are tested and works reliably)
* Status reports (good, bad, etc)
* Toner reports (how much toner is left)
* Can print the printer's built-in testpage

The support for CUPS is limited and usage of Gurich with CUPS should be generally avoided.

== Usage ==
You will store usually postscript files in printfiles/ and then let the driver do the job.
PDFs work, too.

An example for printing:
$ ./bin/gurich -p printfiles/why-open-source-misses-the-point-of-free-software.ps 600 1 A4

For other use cases, e.g seeing how much toner is left:

$ ./bin/gurich -s
[...]
Printer state: GOOD / ENERGY SAVING MODE 2 / IDLE, reference: 0x31
Printer toner information: 80 % left 
Printed out pages (stats): 301

$ ./bin/gurich -h
[...]
print: ./bin/gurich -p [ps/pdf file, resolution (600|1200), copies, paper type (A4 is tested)]
status: ./bin/gurich -s
testpage: ./bin/gurich -t
cups filter: ./bin/gurich -c [filter arguments] (wrapper for -p, does the same job)

You might need to make a rule for udev in order to avoid running gurich with root privileges.

== Thanks to ==
Serge V Shistarev for the PPD file,
but due to licensing difficulties there is instead a script for the actual PPD file.

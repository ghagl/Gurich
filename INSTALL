This driver is in beta stage and therefore, it's not stable and may not work with your printer.
The libraries libusb, (lib)cups and jbigkit are needed in order to compile gurich.

On Parabola GNU/Linux-libre or other Arch GNU/Linux-distributions:
$ sudo pacman -Ss libusb jbigkit libcups

Users of Debian GNU/Linux-like systems can use the utilities apt and apt-get.

This driver is intended for *nix systems and maybe can be compiled using Cygwin,
but no support for Windows is intended since the vendor's driver is already present there.

As always with free software projects, no warranty.

== Compiling ==
$ make all

If you wish to test the CUPS functionality which is currently in alpha stage:
$ sudo make cups
